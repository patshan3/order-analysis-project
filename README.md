# Order Analysis Project

This project models and analyzes **order state transitions** (e.g., `placed → packed → shipped`) to uncover time-based bottlenecks, surface operational insights, and simulate fulfillment pipelines. It uses Python, pandas, and modular design principles to mirror real-world data engineering workflows.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Track time between order states (e.g., placed → inventory_checked)
- Identify slowest stages in the fulfillment pipeline
- Detect anomalies (e.g., orders stuck too long in one stage)
- Aggregate metrics (average time per stage, total fulfillment time)
- Simulate incoming orders and events (optional streaming mode)
- Designed with encapsulation and testable structure using Python classes
